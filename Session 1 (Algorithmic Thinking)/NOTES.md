# Algorithmic thinking

## Definitions

### What is an algorithm?

A series of well-defined instructions to solve a promblem.
Running the exact steps on any similar problem must result the same.

### What is a data structure?

Ways of representing abstractions and models using the semi-theoritical Turing machine we have nowadays.

### Compexity notations

#### Big-O => O(n) [and little-O => o(n)]

Talks about upper-bound of an algorithm.
* Big-O is inclusive.
* Little-O is strict.

#### Big-Omega => Ω(n) [and little-Omega => ω(n)]
Talks about lower-bound of an algorithm.
* Big-Omega is inclusive.
* Little-Omega is strict.

#### Theta => θ(n)
Talks about the order of an algorithm both the upper and lower bounds.

## Peak finding

### One-dimentional

* simple version

* more sophisticated

### Two-dimentional
